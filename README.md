# LeetCode Challenges Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode Challenges Repository! This repository contains solutions to the LeetCode challenges I solve to practice and improve my programming logic and reasoning skills. The solutions are organized by difficulty level.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders, each representing a different level of difficulty:

```
LeetCode-Challenges/
│
├── Easy/
│   ├── problem1.js
│   ├── problem2.js
│   └── ...
│
├── Medium/
│   ├── problem1.js
│   ├── problem2.js
│   └── ...
│
└── Hard/
    ├── problem1.js
    ├── problem2.js
    └── ...
```

- **Easy:** Contains solutions to beginner-friendly problems.
- **Medium:** Contains solutions to intermediate-level problems.
- **Hard:** Contains solutions to advanced-level problems.
